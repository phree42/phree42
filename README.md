### Hello, I'm Dimitar Dimitrov

It's never too late to take a new direction. So at 42 I decided to switch careers. After 7+ years of industrial production planning I'm moving into full stack development. It's a long learning curve, and meanwhile I need the extra income.

Therefore I offer you my skills gained in my previous experience. The main part of my job was to work with data from ERP system coming in different formats (PDF, CSV, messy excel files, plain text) to process it and transfer it to Excel/Sheets where I continue processing it until I achieve the set goals. There was a lot of copy-paste, pivot tables, charts, automating tables, manual typing, etc.

I work quickly and don't take on projects beyond my capabilities.
